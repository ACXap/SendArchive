# SendArchive
Sending multivolume archives by mail (Microsoft Exchange)

This application allows you to send multi-volume archives by mail (Microsoft Exchange).
A letter is created for each individual archive volume and sent.
To work with mail is used: https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-managed-api

The current version already allows you to send files.
But it takes a lot of work.
1) Add languages.
2) Processing the settings file
3) Error handling
